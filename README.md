### Hey there!
I am an entry level developer looking for oppurtunities to learn and create!

I am constantly discovering new development technologies and
experimenting with software architectures.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web app where developers can share their ideas and test their code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use the Angular development framework.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to develop indie video games on my free time.

Checkout my tech blog [here](https://github.com/JeremyParson) to learn about what I'm working on!
